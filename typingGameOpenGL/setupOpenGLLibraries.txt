Statement Purpose:
The objective of this lab is to setup of OpenGL in visual studeio 2012.
Activity Outcomes:

Installation of OpenGL (GLUT/GLEW) in Visual Studio 2012

After installation of Visual Studio 2012, perform the following steps to include libraries and
additional directories of OpenGL
1. Click on File menu  New  Project  click Visual C++  then select Empty

folder  then select Include folderOK
5. Click on Linker Menu on same window  select Input menu  select Additional
Dependencies  write “freeglut.lib” and “glew32.lib”.
6. Click on General option of Linker Menu  Additional Library Directories  Edit 
locate &amp; open OpenGL folder  select and open freeglut folder  select “lib” folder.
7. Add another folder using same options above that isopen OpenGL folder  select and
